        <div class="text"><p> Adriano Celentano (Italian: [adriˈaːno tʃelenˈtaːno]; born 6 January 1938) is an Italian singer, songwriter, musician,
             actor, and filmmaker. He is dubbed "il Molleggiato" (the flexible one) because of his dancing.[1][2]
            Celentano has released many record albums which have enjoyed enormous commercial and critical success.          
            He is often credited as the author of both the music and lyrics of his songs, although, 
            according to his wife Claudia Mori, sometimes they were written in collaboration with others.
             Due to his prolific career and great success, both in Italy and the rest of the world, he is
              considered one of the pillars of Italian music.  </p></div>

        <div class="text2"><p> Heavily influenced by Elvis Presley and the 1950s rock 'n' roll scene as well as by American actor Jerry Lewis,[4]
             Celentano started playing in a rock and roll band with Giorgio Gaber and Enzo Jannacci. With Gaber and Jannacci he was spotted
              by Jolly Records A&R Executive Ezio Leoni, who signed him to his first recording contract and co-authored with Celentano some
               of his greatest early hits, including "24.000 Baci", "Il Tuo Bacio e' Come un Rock", and "Si e' Spento il Sole". He first
                appeared on screen in Ragazzi del Juke-Box, a 1959 Italian musical film directed by Lucio Fulci with music by Ezio Leoni.
                 In 1960, Federico Fellini cast him as a rock and roll singer in his film La Dolce Vita.  </p></div>
